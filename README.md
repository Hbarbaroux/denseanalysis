## DENSEanalysis: Cine DENSE Processing Software ##

This software was developed in MATLAB to provide a user-friendly way of
processing **d**isplacement **en**coding with **s**timulated **e**choes (DENSE)
image data. Currently, the software supports analysis of 2D cine DENSE images;
however, a beta version will be released in the coming months that supports
full biventricular 3D analysis.

### Getting Started

#### System Requirements

The current stable version (0.5.2) of *DENSEanalysis* requires:

* MATLAB (R2009b through R2020b)
* MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox
* MATLAB Curve Fitting Toolbox (Spline Toolbox in later versions)
* MATLAB C-Compiler

#### Configuration of Mex Compiler

If you have never compiled a MATLAB mex file on your current machine, you will
want to configure the MATLAB environment to be able to perform the compilation.
To do this you'll want to run

    mex -setup

This will lead you through a series of steps where MATLAB will detect all
compilers installed on your machine and ask you to select the appropriate
installer.

#### Removal of Previous Installations

If you have previously installed *DENSEanalysis*, make sure to remove any
existing entries in your path that point to that installation of
*DENSEanalysis* and restart MATLAB

To do this you can either type the following command into MATLAB

    pathtool

Or if you wish, you can select **Set Path** from the **File** menu.

Either of these will bring up the path dialog in which you can select the
folders to remove.

#### Download Software

The latest stable release of *DENSEanalysis* can be downloaded
[here][latest] either
as a .zip or .tar.gz archive.

> If you wish to use a bleeding-edge version of DENSEanalysis or you
wish to contribute to DENSEanalysis, you can go to the DENSEanalysis [Github
page][github] and download the source as needed.

Once downloaded, you'll want to extract the contents of the archive to a
directory of your choice on your machine.

Launch MATLAB and change folders to where you extracted the *DENSEanalysis*
software and run the `DENSEsetup` script to finish the installation of the
software.

    cd('path/to/DENSEanalysis')
    DENSEsetup

#### Running *DENSEanalysis* Programs

*DENSEanalysis* is launched by simply typing the following command within the
MATLAB command window

    DENSEanalysis

Similarly, *DENSEms* (Multi-Slice DENSE analysis) can be launched by using the
following command

    DENSEms

#### Additional Documentation

Additional information, including screenshots and examples, can be found at the
following locations

* [RV features manual][rv_manual]

#### A Note on "Motion-Guided Segmentation" ####

If you are used to running *DENSEanalysis*, you will notice that the context
menu for performing motion-guided segmentation is no longer in the application.
This was necessary to release this software as an open-source application. We
have created a custom plugin that restores this functionality. If you are
interested in obtaining this plugin, please contact [Jonathan
Suever](mailto:suever@gmail.com).
